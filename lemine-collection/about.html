        <h1>THE CONTROLLER OF THE COLLECTION</h1>

        <img src="images-collection/author_controller.png" alt="author_image">
    <p>I am Logan Lemine, and I’ve been interested in video games from a young age. My first ever console was a Nintendo DS with a Navy Blue NERF case wrapped around it. Since then, my love of the gaming market has never ceased. I don’t consider myself a collector per se, but when it comes to hardware, I’ve always found a fascination with the gaming sphere. The first console I ever purchased on my own was the Wii U back in 2013, and I’ve gotten various other older systems via family and friends over the years, with the oldest being a Nintendo 64. Of course, with consoles, comes the controller.</p>
        
    <p>When you own so many controllers, they are bound to break eventually. Each controller has a story, and with that comes this collection. This collection houses a cavalcade of stories that paint a picture of various wear and tear from over the years. Whether it be controllers rotted via battery acid, or the slamming of them via human hands, every one of them has some story to tell.</p>
        
    <p>In the real world, I am a Graphic Design major at West Virginia University. I’m currently 21, and as to where my story goes, I’m uncertain. For now though, this collection houses a plethora of experiences from both mine and others lives, which I felt would be perfect to show to others. If you’ve got any stories about your own controllers, send me a message in the contact form located in the FAQ page!</p>
        
    <p>My next level in life is still loading!</p>

    <h2>Control the Chaos!</h2>

    <p>Controllers are an under appreciated aspect of the gaming sphere. Every controller has a story, and broken controllers are no different. Whether they’re caked in battery acid, chewed up, or totally smashed, each and every gaming peripheral tells a tale. These controllers are no different. </p>

        <div class="FAQ_header">
        <h1>1. Why did you start this collection?</h1>
        </div> 

        <p>This collection was created via a love of gaming. Since my youth, I have been collecting various forms of consoles. More information can be found about this in the about section.</p>

        <div class="faq_header_two">
    <h2>2. Why are so many of your controllers broken?</h2>
        </div>

        <p>Not all of them are broken, but when you play so many games, they are bound to break sooner or later. Granted, some of them are worse off than others, and were damaged via external causes, but with every damaged controller comes a story. From that, this collection (of another collection) was born.</p>
        
        <div class="FAQ_header_three">
    <h3>3. Do you plan on collecting more broken controllers in the future?</h3>
        </div>

    <p>It all depends on what consoles, peripherals, and technology is introduced in the future. As of now, I plan on purchasing the Switch 2, and I’m sure I’ll get the camera with it. I also expect to get some more peripherals for my PS5. In short, don’t expect many new additions in the future, unless they are from older hardware.</p>

    <div class="FAQ_header_four">
    <h4>4. Do you throw away your broken controllers?</h4>
    </div>

    <p>If it wasn’t obvious, I have a hard time parting way with things. It’s less so about wanting to part with them, and more so just due to being lazy and/or forgetting to toss them out. In a roundabout sense, my laziness inadvertently created something to add to my already present console collection. That being said, I’ve definitely thrown away various controllers over the years. Most recently, I tossed out a Purple Right Joycon. It was damaged after my ex accidentally nudged my Switch from the couch to the floor, which landed on it’s side, and messed up the rail-slider on its side.</p>
